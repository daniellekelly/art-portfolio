        <h3>Artist's Statement</h3>
        <p>My work is highly process-oriented.  Whether I am working in painting, drawing, or making mixed media pieces, the act of making the work remains evident in my finished pieces.  My subject matter varies; recently I have been interested in both the figure and the landscape.  The materials I use most often are gouache, pen, graphite, marker, or watercolor.  I also cut and paste a variety of papers onto my surfaces. 

Regardless of the final medium, a piece will typically begin as a drawing. I draw in order to experiment with and begin to express moods and feelings. Many ideas never leave the initial experimental stage; those that do go on to become finalized pieces are ideas that fully captivate my imagination or resonate with my own life experiences.

 

As a sketch develops, its final medium becomes clear. While visual appeal plays a significant role in my choices, my collaged pieces are influenced by a juxtaposition of external ideas from newspapers, magazines, and other image sources. For example, I will oftentimes take a newspaper clipping and interpolate it into my original ideas, crossing out irrelevant phrases to create new meaning in the text of the clipping. Meanwhile, a painted piece has a more loose and freeform development process and explores a concentrated idea. A purely drawn piece is among the most personal; my energies become focused purely on expression and less on experimental technique.

 

Artwork that comes out of the imagination is what inspires me the most. I am fascinated by Swoon because of her large-scale woodcut and cut-out portraits that evoke a sense of wonder.  Henry Darger’s work interests me because of the depth of the imaginary world that he has created.  Amy Cutler is another artist that I find very exciting because of the strange narratives within her work. I also appreciate Odilon Redon’s lithographic works because of their strangeness.  In some regards, my influences are shown in my work, such as in the strangeness and in the imaginative qualities of my work.</p>
